Alternatively you can add these two commands in run.sh (Unix/MacOs) or run.bat (Windows) and execute it.

# run.sh/run.bat content for executing test cases
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd tests
python3 -m test_metro_station_account
python3 -m test_metro_card_user
```


# execute run.sh/run.bat using
